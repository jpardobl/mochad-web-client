mochad-web-client
=================

Mochad web GUI writen in Django. Jet very simple django project which enable us to issue X10 commands through mochad.
So far, the project is very simple. It handles the communication with mochad through command line calls. And it is only 
meant for switching commands, not dim, nor xdim.

I'll keep developing the project as soon as I buy more types of X10 receivers. Anyway, not worth to say that contributions
are wellcome.
